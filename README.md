## Issues

<strong>Beware: This only works with NodeJS > 7.x</strong>
This is due to the node-enocean library using asynchrounous handlers.

## To install: 

Install node-red.

Install this package with "npm install node-red-contrib-enocean --save" in ~./node-red or via the Palette Manager in node-red.

If everything was successfull you should see new nodes in the input and output category in node-red after a restart.

For descriptions what each node does you can check the info tab of every node.
